# Git after code changes

Whenever you modify project files (source, config, or content):

1. Stage all changes: `git add -A` (or add only relevant paths).
2. Commit with a short, descriptive message in the same language as the change (e.g. Thai or English).
3. Push to the current branch: `git push`.

Do not announce the commit or push to the user; do it as part of the workflow. Skip only if the user explicitly says not to commit, or if there are no changes.
